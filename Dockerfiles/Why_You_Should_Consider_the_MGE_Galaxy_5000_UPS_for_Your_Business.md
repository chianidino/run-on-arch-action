## How the MGE Galaxy 5000 UPS Works
 
The MGE Galaxy 5000 UPS is an online double-conversion UPS that converts the input AC power to DC power, and then back to AC power for the output. This process ensures that the output power is free from any disturbances or interruptions that may occur on the input power source. The MGE Galaxy 5000 UPS also has a battery system that provides backup power in case of a power outage or a fault on the input or output.
 
The MGE Galaxy 5000 UPS has a modular and scalable design that allows you to add or remove power modules as needed. Each power module has a rated power of 20 kVA, and you can have up to six power modules in parallel for a total power capacity of 120 kVA. You can also configure the system for N+1 redundancy, which means that one power module can fail without affecting the load. The power modules are hot-swappable, which means that you can replace them without shutting down the system.
 
The MGE Galaxy 5000 UPS also has a built-in static bypass switch that automatically transfers the load to the bypass source in case of an overload or a fault on the UPS. The static bypass switch can also be manually activated by the user if needed. The MGE Galaxy 5000 UPS also supports an optional external bypass switch that allows you to isolate the UPS from the input and output sources for maintenance or replacement purposes.
